# FFNN-for-Handwritten-Digits

- A simple python application for recognizing handwritten digits as a mini project using Deep Learning
- Used Feedforward Neural Networks in Deep Learning
- Used technologies : Python 3.6, TensorFlow (An end-to-end free and open-source machine learning software library platform), Keras (An open-source neural-network library for Python which is capable of running on top of TensorFlow), MNIST Database (A large database of handwritten digits) and other necessary python libraries (MatPlotLib)
- Text editors & IDEs : Google Colab (Colaboratory) - A free cloud service which supports free GPU in Jupyter notebook environment
